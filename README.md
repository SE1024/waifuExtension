# waifuExtension
The waifu2x on Mac.

The new version is capable of taking advantages of CPU, GPU, and [ANE](https://github.com/hollance/neural-engine).

## Usage
- Enlarge videos or images with machine learning on Mac.
- Interpolate frames for videos.

## Install
Files and source code could be found in [releases](https://github.com/Vaida12345/waifuExtension/releases).

Note: If mac says the app was damaged / unknown developer, please go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General`, and click `Open Anyway`. [Show Details.](https://github.com/Vaida12345/Annotation/wiki#why-i-cant-open-the-app)

## Privacy
This app works completely offline and requires no internet connection. Nothing is collected or stored, expect for:
- Your settings stored in its [containter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/1413045-nshomedirectory/).
- Temp images in during comparison. (These files will be deleted when the windows is closed.)
- Temp images during processing in its container, the existance would only last for three lines of code, after which it is deleted.
- Output files and logs (if you turn on "enable log" or "enable dev" in preference) in its output path.

If the app crashes, please choose not to share crash log with Apple.

## Models
The models where obtained from [waifu2x-caffe](https://github.com/lltcggie/waifu2x-caffe), and translated to coreML via [coremltools](https://github.com/apple/coremltools).

Other models are:
 - [dain-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/dain-ncnn-vulkan)
 - [realsr-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/realsr-ncnn-vulkan)
 - [cain-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/cain-ncnn-vulkan)
 - [realcugan-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/realcugan-ncnn-vulkan)
 - [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)
 - [rife-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/rife-ncnn-vulkan)

## Note
This app was based on the work of [waifu2x-ios](https://github.com/imxieyi/waifu2x-ios). Nearly all the files in the folder "waifu2x-mac" were created by him. However, modifications were done to improve speed.

## Speed
When processing a standard 1080p image (1920 Ã— 1080) using Waifu2x Caffe, MacBook Pro with the M1 Max chip took only 0.7 seconds.

## Interface
This app was written with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/).
